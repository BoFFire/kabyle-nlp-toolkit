# Kabyle NLP Toolkit

This repository provides a lightweight, modular toolkit for processing the Tatoeba corpus specifically for Kabyle and English, including downloading, extracting, and generating a bilingual corpus; splitting the corpus into separate language files; and automatically fixing nonâ€‘standard characters in Kabyle text to conform to a standardized character set.
